        <p>I studied Human Communication and graduated from Cal State Montery Bay Cum Laude with the goal of entering the
          video game industry as a community manager. Life had a different path in mind for me and I found myself teaching
          English abroad in Spain. After two years of teaching my contract expired and I came back to the States with the goal of
          completely shifting career paths. Two years was enough for me to realize that teaching was not my thing, and though I tried
          to get in to the video game industry upon my return, my lack of experience in the field barred me from entry.
        </p>
        <p>My goals now are still in line with the video game industry. As a lifelong gamer I've always wanted to turn my hobbie into
          a career. During my two years in Spain I became interested in the programming world and thought it would be a great way for me
          to broaden my skillset and eventually help me get in to the gaming industry.
        </p>
        <p>For now my goals are simple: Master my craft. Programming is a whole new ball game- something I've never done and in a field of
          study completely different from what I'm used to. As a lifelong English guy, going towards a Math career is daunting but exciting and
          new. I'm excited to see what challenges are in store and just how far I can go down the programming rabbit hole.
